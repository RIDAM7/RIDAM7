## Hi, I’m Ridam 👋

I’m a **product-focused full-stack developer** who builds and deploys practical web applications — from frontend and backend to hosting and AI integration.

I enjoy working on real-world products that solve clear business problems, especially in SaaS-style applications and admin-driven systems.

## 🧩 What I Work On

- Full-stack web applications using **React, Node.js, and MongoDB**
- SaaS-style products with **authentication and role-based access**
- Admin and internal dashboards
- REST API design and backend architecture
- AI-assisted features with human-in-the-loop workflows
- Deployment and production maintenance

I focus on building things that are **usable, maintainable, and actually used**.
